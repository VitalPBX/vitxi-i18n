## How to translate to your language
- Clone the repo or download the files
- Download and Install the [i18n Manager tool](https://github.com/gilmarsquinelato/i18n-manager/releases). You can also use the [BabelEdit tool](https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit), which is a paid application that gives you a trial of 14 days.
- Open the i18n Manager tool, then open the "locales" folder on it.

Finally, after opening the folder "locales" using the i18n Manager tool, you will see the different languages for translating.

After finishing the translations, you can make a pull request or send us your translations by e-mail(support@vitalpbx.com) to apply them in the upcoming versions of the VitXi WebRTC app.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us(support@vitalpbx.com).
